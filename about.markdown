I work as a data engineer solving problems and maintaining solutions in the data pipelining and migration space.

Educationally, I have degrees in Mathematics (BS) and Data Science (MS).

I enjoy solving problems at the confluence of mathematics, computing, and operations research! To this end, my hobby projects revolve around solving problems in the mathematical planning space. More specifically, I am actively building and refining tools to optimally build weekly meal-plans according to constraints.

    this is an interesting codeblock!
